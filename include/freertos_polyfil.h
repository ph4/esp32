 *
 * WARNING: BACKPORTED from freeRTOS trunk 27.12.2021
 * configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY must be defined as 1 for this function to be
 * available.  See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 * Populates a TaskStatus_t structure with information about a task.
 *
 * @param xTask Handle of the task being queried.  If xTask is NULL then
 * information will be returned about the calling task.
 *
 * @param pxTaskStatus A pointer to the TaskStatus_t structure that will be
 * filled with information about the task referenced by the handle passed using
 * the xTask parameter.
 *
 * @xGetFreeStackSpace The TaskStatus_t structure contains a member to report
 * the stack high water mark of the task being queried.  Calculating the stack
 * high water mark takes a relatively long time, and can make the system
 * temporarily unresponsive - so the xGetFreeStackSpace parameter is provided to
 * allow the high water mark checking to be skipped.  The high watermark value
 * will only be written to the TaskStatus_t structure if xGetFreeStackSpace is
 * not set to pdFALSE;
 *
 * @param eState The TaskStatus_t structure contains a member to report the
 * state of the task being queried.  Obtaining the task state is not as fast as
 * a simple assignment - so the eState parameter is provided to allow the state
 * information to be omitted from the TaskStatus_t structure.  To obtain state
 * information then set eState to eInvalid - otherwise the value passed in
 * eState will be reported as the task state in the TaskStatus_t structure.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * void vAFunction( void )
 * {
 * TaskHandle_t xHandle;
 * TaskStatus_t xTaskDetails;
 *
 *  // Obtain the handle of a task from its name.
 *  xHandle = xTaskGetHandle( "Task_Name" );
 *
 *  // Check the handle is not NULL.
 *  configASSERT( xHandle );
 *
 *  // Use the handle to obtain further information about the task.
 *  vTaskGetInfo( xHandle,
 *                &xTaskDetails,
 *                pdTRUE, // Include the high water mark in xTaskDetails.
 *                eInvalid ); // Include the task state in xTaskDetails.
 * }
 * </pre>
